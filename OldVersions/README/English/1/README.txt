Features to replicate

There is not enough data yet. I cannot compile a list of features or changes yet. The base operating system isn't planned to be released until Autumn of 2022, and data won't likely be immediately complete then either.

Feature dump (incomplete)

```diff
++ Widgets have been completely revamped, they are no longer constrained to the Notification Center—instead they can be placed anywhere on the desktop, and the widget picker has been redesigned to resemble the iPadOS version of it.
++ The lock screen has been redesigned to include the date and time similar to iOS and iPadOS.
++ Video-conferencing apps can overlay the presenter's webcam video on top of screen sharing.
++ App icons and the spotlight search bar have been made more rounded.
++ Safari:
++++ Browsing profiles enable separate sets of bookmarks, extensions, and cookies, which can be used to separate, for example, a personal setup from the work one.
++++ Password sharing lets multiple people have access to the same collection of website passwords, and update them as needed, with changes syncing across all enrolled devices.
++++ “Web apps” lets the user add any website to the Dock and open it in a simplified Safari interface. This feature is somewhat different from progressive web apps since it doesn't require additional work of website developers.
++ Messages:
++++ More precise search filters: for example, the contact name can be combined with a search term to look for the term within the specific conversation.
++++ Catch-up lets the user quickly jump to the first unread message in a conversation.
++++ iMessage stickers have a new picker interface.
++ Game mode, to optimize gaming performance by prioritizing gaming tasks and allocating more GPU and CPU capacity to the game.
++ New slow-motion screen savers of different locations worldwide. When logged in, they transform into the desktop wallpaper.
```

## Feature translation notes

The exact system requirements are not a forced emulation option. The WacOS system is designed to be lighter, but you can adjust it to match MacOS.

WacOS equivalents of programs are included.

Malicious methods (such as DRM/TPM) are NEVER included with WacOS, not even as an open source recreation.

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/issues/) if any other clarification is needed.

## Home repositories

[Guesthouse repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS_14/)

This is a guesthouse repository, and not a home repository, as development mainly stays on the main WacOS side. This is just the guesthouse that the project retreats to at times. If you are already in this repository, the link is likely recursive, and will reload the page.
